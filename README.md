# Neural Networks From Scratch
This is a python package which implements a variety of tools for creating
neural networks from scratch, using `numpy` as the main computational
package. This includes the models, layers, activation functions, optimization
functions for training models, and so on. In addition, this package makes
heavy use of vectorization for performance and as such does not require the
use of a GPU for calculations.

Overall, this package is meant to be more educational than functional, allowing
for insight into how the components of a neural network function and how training
is performed.

See [`examples`](examples) for a Jupyter notebook in which this package is used
for the MNIST problem.
