# Neural Networks From Scratch
This is a python package which attempts to implement a variety of tools for
creating neural networks from scratch, using `numpy` as the main computational
package. This includes the models, layers, activation functions, optimization
functions for training models, and so on.

For more information, see the documentation in [`docs`](docs).
